# subtitles_download

# One of my first scripts in python to download subtitles for whole season of TV shows.
# You need to enter url corresponding to the site of TV show of your choosing with every episode listed on it.
# Then you need to provide the name of the show in order to give your zip packages with subtitles the proper name.
# You need to insert the last package of subtitles that you downloaded correctly, because non-user can download only 40 subtitles a day on opensubtitles.
# If you give enter 0 then it will start downloading from episode 1 to the last one. 
# There is no error checking if the file was downloaded correctly.
# In future I plan to do this with API provided by opensubtitles.
